# picoro
A minimal implementation of coroutines in plain C.
The original version was implemented and published by Tony Finch.
His description of how it works is on his blog: [Coroutines in less than 20 lines of standard C](https://fanf.livejournal.com/105413.html).

This fork exists mostly to add some documentation.
